We notice that you have either downloaded BookTrakker or attempted to do so. Is
everything working OK? We pride ourselves on having the best customer support
in the industry. Support during the trial is free. Support for the free version
is by email only. We also provide extensive pre-purchase support as well, at no
charge.<br>
<br>
Please do take advantage of our support before you spend endless hours trying
to figure the program out. Changing database programs can be very challenging,
or even starting fresh. <br>
<br>
General instructions not covered in Help can be found here: <a

instructions are available at: <a
href="http://www.booktrakker.com/help/HelpResourceCenter.htm" eudora=autourl>http://www.booktrakker.com/help/HelpResourceCenter.htm</a>

using Homebase or Readerware for ISBN collection/import into BookTrakker. <br>
<br>
Read <span style='font-family:Arial'>Online Service Wizard Setup </span>to
learn how to setup for uploads to the services.<br>
<br>
If you are having difficulty doing the import of your data into BookTrakker
from another program, please let us know and we may be able to do this for you.
Turnaround time varies from a few hours to a couple of days, depending on how
busy we are. <br>
<br>

contact Support immediately! Reply to this message or click <a

<br>
<br>
BookTrakker has a lot of features and advanced technology that sometimes can be
overwhelming. So when in doubt, please follow the First Law of using
BookTrakker: Contact Support! Phone numbers and email at the end of this
message.<br>
<br>
Please note that the version of the software you have downloaded is a 30-day
trial. During the trial, you will be able to use all the features of the full
program. This includes uploading to any service you are subscribed to that
BookTrakker supports. You will be notified when the trial expires, you then go
into a Grace Period with instructions on how to subscribe each time you open
BookTrakker.&nbsp; After the end of the Grace period, you will only be able to
perform limited data-entry and export functions with the software. This loss of
features only affects the interface to the program -- none of your inventory
data is changed in any way by the expiration of the Grace period. <br>
<br>
At any time you can open App Manager and click the Payments button at the
bottom to start your subscription. <br>
<br>
Bookseller Subscription rates are posted here: <br>

eudora=autourl>http://www.booktrakker.com/BTPro_V36/BTBooksellerEditionsSubscribe.htm<br>
<br>
</a>If you are a Collector and do not need to upload you can find the
subscription rates here:<br>

<br>
</a>There is only the time limit with this installation of BookTrakker. There
is no record limit. Theoretically the database can handle up to 2,000,000,000
records, although we do not know of anyone attempting this.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Play with BookTrakker. Setting the data source for data lookup is controlled in
Tools &gt; Options &gt; ISBN as well as in GrabIt, by clicking the plugins
button at the top of Inventory, then the Settings tab, left side.<br>
<br>
Do a New Record, click OK, click on the Keywords tab, then click into the ISBN 
field on the left. You are now in the ISBN field. Type in an ISBN, press Enter. 
If the ISBN is on Amazon and you are an Amazon Pro Merchant seller and you did 
the Amazon Seller Account Registration in App Manager then data is downloaded 
into BookTrakker. Finish data entry, then click Done or Next record to do another. 
ASIN works like ISBN if you get the ASIN from Amazon.
<br>
We also have ISBN ONLY lookup available from ISBNdb.com. You pay them $9.95/mo for their service. Create an account via Tools > Options > ISBN.
<br>
<br>
If you want your own Tab Order then do Tools &gt; Tab Order, click F1 for Help.
(See above if Help does not work)<br>
<br>
The Sample Database has 100 records so you can see how data looks or to do some
Hit Lists. do not allow it to exceed 120 records before doing Tools &gt;
Options &gt; Records and clicking the Delete Sample Database button if you need
to import data or start with fresh data entry, no data to import. (If we do the
import then the database we send you replaces the Sample database) <br>
<br>
Enter or Tab moves you through the data entry form. <br>
<br>
Tools &gt; Options is where we store defaults. Lots of them. <br>
<br>
Uploads happen with the click of a button to all sites BookTrakker supports.
OneClick. <br>
<br>
BookTrakker has Hit Lists. Hit Lists allow you to find records based on Search
Criteria, such as how many books are priced below $15 or £15 that were listed
before 12/31/2007. Or just about any other Criteria you want. For Homebase
users who had Catalogs, and imported their data, Catalogs are now Categories in
Hit Lists: Category List.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Once you understand how BookTrakker works you can either start entering records
or import your data or download/install the database we created when we
imported your data from Homebase or some other program.<br>
<br>
