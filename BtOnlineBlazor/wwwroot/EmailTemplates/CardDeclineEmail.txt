Dear [Name],

Your payment did not process. Your Renew Date is [RenewDate], BookTrakker will stop working after [EndDate]

The card may be failing because of insufficient funds, you can fix this by supplying the credit card company with enough funds for the charge to process.

If the card has expired or you changed cards then you need to reprocess payment through App Manager. 

Before you do that you may need to go to

	https://payments.amazon.com/CCList 

to update your card, or click the green Update Payment Card button at the bottom right corner in App Manager.

Open App Manager and click the "Pay" button that appears to the left of the Blue Submit buttons. Confirm the subscription amount is correct, click OK. Confirm again, click [button]. Login to Amazon Payments. Select or update your payment method, check the box to confirm amount, click Activate Subscription button.

Thank you,

Andy
